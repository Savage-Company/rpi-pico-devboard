# Raspberry Pi Pico Development Board

The RPi Pico is a great low cost powerful ARM based development platform. This dev board enhances the platform with a carrier board with:

- A debug host (using picoprobe) for on chip debugging of code
- A serial interface (again via picoprobe)
- The missing reset button!
- Breakout of all pins from the pico
- Development target powered by either the VSys or VBus sources

Compatible with all Pico variants

- Pico
- Pico-H
- Pico-W
